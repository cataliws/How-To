# Finalize Your New Website

Your website has been created! Now, you just need to complete a few final steps to ensure a smooth experience for you and your customers.

Although your website exists online at your chosen domain, visitors won't be able to see your content and offers until you officially publish it.

## Complete the Setup Guide

On your website dashboard, located at `app.cataliws.com/ws/{your-domain.com}`, you'll find a setup guide. This is a simple task list to help you get everything in order. The color of each task indicates its priority:

-   **Red:** These tasks are mandatory and must be completed before you can publish.
-   **Yellow/Amber:** These tasks are highly recommended for the best results, but are not compulsory.
-   **White:** These tasks are optional, but completing them will help enhance your website.

Each task includes a brief description and a button or link to help you complete it quickly.

## Publishing Your Website

Once you have completed the required tasks (especially the red and yellow ones), you're ready to go live!

Click the **Publish** button on your website dashboard. An OTP will be sent to the owner's email address. Enter that OTP and click **Continue** to publish your website for the world to see.
