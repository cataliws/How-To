## Creating a Highlight
To get started, navigate to the **Highlights** section of your dashboard. You can do this by clicking the **Highlights** link in the sidebar or by visiting the page directly at `app.cataliws.com/ws/{your-domain.com}/highlights`.

You will see a list of any existing highlights. To add a new one, click the **Start** button in the bottom-right corner of the page and select the **New Highlight** button.

In the Highlight Editor window that appears, fill out the following fields:
1. Choose the **Type/Category** of the highlight entry.
2. Enter a **Title** (between 5 and 128 characters).
3. Enter a **Description** (between 72 and 256 characters).
4. Enter a **Link** (optional). This is the URL of the page you want to send visitors to when they click the highlight.
5. When ready, click the **Save** button.

## Managing Existing Highlights
From the Highlights page, you'll see a list of all the highlights you've created. On the right side of each list item, you will find self-explanatory buttons for actions like **Edit**, **Delete**, and **Set Banner**.

### Reordering Highlights
To change the order of your highlights in the slideshow, simply click and drag an item to your desired position in the list.

**Note:** Only the top 5 active highlights are displayed on your website at a time. You can move older items down the list or delete them to make room for new ones at the top.

### Changing the Highlight Banner
To set or change the image for a highlight, click the **Set Banner** button for that item. This will open the file manager. You can then locate an existing image or upload a new one. Click the cog (settings) icon on your desired image and select **Make highlight banner** from the menu.
