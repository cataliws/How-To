## Offer Terminology

Here are some key terms to familiarize yourself with for managing your offers effectively.

### Offer Variants

A variant is a specific version of an offer with distinct properties, such as a different color, size, or price. For example, imagine you sell a "Luxury Silk Men's Shirt" that comes in two styles (Plain, Embroidered) and three colors (Red, Blue, White). Instead of creating six separate offers, you create one main offer and then add variants for each combination:

1.  Default (Style: Plain, Color: White)
2.  Plain - Red (Style: Plain, Color: Red)
3.  Plain - Blue (Style: Plain, Color: Blue)
4.  Embroidered - White (Style: Embroidered, Color: White)
5.  Embroidered - Blue (Style: Embroidered, Color: Blue)
6.  Embroidered - Red (Style: Embroidered, Color: Red)

### Offer Addons
Addons are accessories or extra services sold alongside a main offer. The price of an addon can be included in the main offer's price, or it can have its own price that is added at checkout.

For the shirt example above, addons could be:
- Cufflinks (designed specifically for the shirt)
- Matching Hat

### Offer Subscriptions
This feature applies to services that require recurring payments. It enables automated payment collection from subscribers based on defined terms and prices.

**Note:** This feature may not be enabled for all offer types. If you require it but don't see the option, please contact our support team to request manual activation.

### Offer Reservations
Reservations apply to services that require booking, such as remote or onsite sessions. Examples include:
- Hotel stays
- Consulting sessions
- Event tickets

You will find this option on the offer management page for applicable offer types.

### Product Brand, and Version
These fields allow for extended customization, especially for physical products:
- **Brand**: The manufacturer of the product.
- **Product**: The brand's product name or line.
- **Version/Model**: The specific product model or version.

To set these properties, find the **Product Brand** section on the offer management page and click **Manage**.

## Creating and Managing Offers

Hereâ€™s how to get started with creating and publishing offers on your website.

### Create a New Offer
To create a new offer:

1. Navigate to your Offers page: `app.cataliws.com/ws/{your-domain.com}/offers`.
2. Find and click the **Start** button in the bottom-right corner of the page.
3. Click the **Create Offer** button.
4. In the pop-up window, click **Choose Photos** to select images for your offer (you can also do this later).
5. Select the offer **Type** and **Category** from the two dropdown menus.
6. Enter a descriptive **Offer Title**.
7. Write the offer **Description** in the text area. You can use Markdown to format your text. The description must be between `128` and `5,120` characters long.
8. Add search **Keywords** to help customers find your offer. Keywords should be comma-separated, and only letters, numbers, and dashes (`-`) are allowed. The total length must be between `25` and `128` characters.
9. For physical products, provide optional packaging information to help calculate shipping costs: `Length`, `Height` (Min: `10cm`), and `Width` in centimeters (`cm`), and `Weight` in grams (`g`) (Min: `100g`).
10. If you wish to publish the offer immediately, check the **Publish** option. Otherwise, it will be saved as a draft.
11. If you are satisfied with your input, click the **Save** button.

If all goes well, your offer will be saved. You can then refresh the offer list to see the new entry at the top. If you encounter an error, an explanation will appear with instructions on how to resolve it.

### Manage an Existing Offer

On the **Offers Page**, you will see a list of all your created offers. Each entry has quick action buttons to `Manage`, `Delete`, `Create Addon`, and `Add Stock`.

#### Delete an Offer
To permanently delete an offer, click the `Delete` button and confirm the prompt. Since a deleted offer cannot be recovered, consider temporarily unpublishing it from the **Offer Manager** if you might need it later. An offer that has already been purchased cannot be deleted, but you can disable it to remove it from your public website.

#### Add Stock
To quickly add stock to the default variant of an offer, click the **Stock** button on the list item. You can manage stock for individual variants from within the **Offer Manager**.

2. **To manage addon categories:**
    1. Click the **Manage Categories** link.
    2. Click the **Plus (+)** button to add a new category.
    3. Fill in the `Title`, optional `Description`, and a unique `Name`.
    4. Click **Save**.
3. **To create a new addon:**
    1. Click the **Plus (+)** button in the Addons window.
    2. Enter a `Title`, select a `Category`, and set a `Price` (leave blank if it has no extra cost).
    3. Check `Auto Select` if the addon should be automatically added to a customer's order.
    4. Uncheck `Multi Select` if customers can only choose one of this addon type per order.
    5. Click the **Save** button when you're done.
