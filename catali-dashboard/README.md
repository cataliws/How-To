## About the Dashboard

The Catali Dashboard is your central hub for creating and managing websites and accessing all the powerful features of the **Catali Web Stores platform**.

To get started, open your web browser and go to [app.cataliws.com](https://app.cataliws.com). From there, you can log in to an existing account or create a new one.

## Your Catali Account

Your Catali Account is your personal key to the entire Catali ecosystem, giving you access to all our tools and services.

### Creating a Catali Account

1.  Go to [app.cataliws.com/user/sign-up](https://app.cataliws.com/user/sign-up).
2.  Fill out the registration form with your correct personal information.
3.  Click the **Sign Up** button.
4.  We'll send a One-Time Password (OTP) to the email address you provided.
5.  Enter this OTP in the pop-up window and click **Continue**.

Once successful, your account will be created, and you'll be automatically signed in and guided to the dashboard to start creating your first website. You can visit the Account Center at any time to manage your personal information.

If you run into any issues, just follow the on-screen instructions. They're designed to help you solve the problem quickly.

#### Choosing a Secure Password

When creating your Catali Account, make sure to use a strong password to keep your account secure. A strong password is over 8 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (like `!`, `@`, `#`, etc.).

### Signing In to the Catali Dashboard

To sign in to your dashboard, go to [app.cataliws.com/user/sign-in](https://app.cataliws.com/user/sign-in) and enter your Profile ID. This can be:
- Your Catali Account profile code (an 11-15 digit code starting with `252`),
- Your registered email address,
- Or your registered phone number.

Next, enter your password and click the **Sign In** button. Checking the **Remember Me** box will keep you logged in on that browser for 5 days. For your security, we recommend only using this option on your personal, trusted devices.

### Forgotten Your Password?

Forgotten your password? No problem! Visit [app.cataliws.com/user/password/reset](https://app.cataliws.com/user/password/reset).

Enter your Profile ID (your account code, email, or phone number). Type your new password, confirm it, and then click the **Reset** button. An OTP will be sent to your registered email address. Enter the OTP you receive and click **Continue**. Your password will be updated, and you can now log in with your new credentials.

## Your Catali Website

Think of your Catali Website as your all-in-one online business hub. It's designed to be simple to set up and manage, yet powerful and packed with possibilities.

### Creating a Catali Website

Once you're signed in to your [Catali Dashboard](#signing-in-to-the-catali-dashboard), click the "*Create new website*" link or go directly to [app.cataliws.com/get-ws](https://app.cataliws.com/get-ws). Follow these simple, interactive steps to build your new website:

1.  **Choose your color theme.**
2.  **Choose your preferred market region.** This should be the primary location of your target customers or audience.
3.  **Provide an Entity name** (e.g., the name of your business) and set an acronym for it.
4.  **Choose your offering type** (e.g., Service, Product).
5.  **Select a Category and Subcategory** from the dropdown menus.
6.  **Write an introduction for your website.** Our AI may suggest one for you automatically. You can also click the **Ask AI** link to generate new ideas.
7.  **Add your search keywords.** These are comma-separated words and phrases that describe your business and what you offer, making it easier for people to find you online. Our AI can also suggest keywords for you, or you can enter them manually.

#### Using 'Ask AI' for the First Time

The first time you use our 'Ask AI' generative tool, you might receive some free tokens to get you started! If you're eligible, you'll see a gift link in the AI chat window.

### Finalizing Your Website

When you've filled in all the details and are happy with them, click the **Continue** button.

Next, you'll customize your free **Catali Domain**. This is a free web address for your site, like `your-business.catali.shop`. You can always add a custom top-level domain (like `your-business.com`) later on.

Don't worry if you encounter an error. We'll always provide a clear explanation of the problem and how you can fix it.

#### Common Creation Errors & Tips

To ensure a smooth setup, pay close attention to the following fields:

-   **Entity `Name`**: Must be between 5 and 128 characters.
-   **Entity `Type`**: Make sure you've selected an option (e.g., Product, Service).
-   **`Category` and `Subcategory`**: Both dropdowns must have a selection.
-   **`Intro`**: Your introduction text must be between 128 and 512 characters.
-   **`Keywords`**: Use comma-separated words. Only dashes (`-`) and spaces are allowed as special characters. The total length should be between 25 and 128 characters.
-   **`Domain`**: When choosing your free domain, like `my-shop.catali.shop`, the `my-shop` part can only contain letters, numbers, and dashes (`-`). No spaces or other symbols are allowed.
-   **Contact `Email`**: When setting up your contact email (e.g., `sales@my-shop.catali.shop`), you only need to enter the first part (`sales`). The rest is generated automatically.

Pay attention to the pop-up alerts. They'll show you the status of your request and provide clear instructions if there's an error.

If you've double-checked everything and still face an error on the final step, you don't need to start over! Click the **Get Help** link and describe the issue in as much detail as possible. For immediate assistance, use our live chat feature right on the page.

### Success! Your Website is Ready

Congratulations! Once your website is created, a pop-up window will appear. Here, you can choose a premium subscription plan and payment method to unlock more features.
